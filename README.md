# Simple ATM-machine
This simple banking app allows users to perform deposit and withdrawal operations on their account balance. The app provides a straightforward user interface with buttons for deposit and withdrawal, input fields for entering the transaction amount, and a balance display.

# Features
Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their account by entering the deposit amount and clicking the "Deposit" button.

Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their account by entering the withdrawal amount and clicking the "Withdraw" button.

Real-time Balance: The app displays the current account balance in real-time.

Balance Status: The background color of the account container changes based on the account balance. If the balance is zero, the background turns red; otherwise, it turns to a neutral color.

# Usage
To use the banking app:

Open the HTML file in a web browser.

Enter the deposit or withdrawal amount in the respective input field.

Click the "Deposit" button to add funds or the "Withdraw" button to deduct funds.

The real-time balance is displayed, and the background color of the account container changes based on the balance status.

# How it Works
The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses simple event listeners to capture button clicks and perform deposit and withdrawal operations. The account balance is updated in real-time, and the background color changes dynamically based on the balance.
